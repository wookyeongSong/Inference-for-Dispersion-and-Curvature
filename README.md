# Inference-for-Dispersion-and-Curvature


## General Information

This repository contains the implementation for the paper **"Inference for Dispersion and Curvature of Random Objects"** which were run using R 4.3.1. It provides two one-click *wrapper* R scripts that reproduce every table and figure in the main manuscript and the supplement.

## Wrapper R scripts

It contains two wrapper R scripts:
*	`DC_wrapper_main.R`: Executes all analyses presented in the main paper and reproduces all the Tables 1-2 and corresponding Figures 2-7, which are saved as PDF files.
*	`DC_wrapper_supplement.R`: Executes all additional simulations and real data analyses in the Supplement of the paper and reproduces the Table S.1 and the corresponding Figures S.1-S.10, which are saved as PDF files.

For running the wrapper R scripts, 
1. Clone or download the repository and set your R working directory to the project root.
2. Download the gait synchronization dataset from [link][https://github.com/deepcharles/gait-data] as referenced in Truong et al. (2019), "A data set for the study of human locomotion with inertial measurement units," Image Processing On Line, 9, 381â€“390.
3. Set the file path to the downloaded gait data in `Applications/DC_gait.R` file before running the script.
4. Run the wrapper scripts using either `source("DC_wrapper_main.R")` in an R console or `Rscript DC_wrapper_main.R` in a terminal.

## Details on reproducing results, figures, and tables 

In `simulations` folder:
* `/DC_sphere_contam.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure 2 in Section 4.2.
* `/DC_distribution.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure S.6, and Figure S.8 in Section 5.1, Section S.5, and Section S.6.
* `/DC_pointcloud.R`: Produces results corresponding to Table 1 and Figure 5 in Section 5.2.
* `/DC_spd.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure S.1 in Section S.1.1.
* `/DC_sphere.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure S.2 in Section S.1.2.
* `/DC_power_analysis.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure S.3 in Section S.1.3.
* `/DC_highdim.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure S.4 in Section S.1.4.

In `Applications` folder:
* `/DC_gait.R`: Before running this script, set the file path to the gait synchronization data, available at [https://github.com/deepcharles/gait-data]. Running this R code will produce results corresponding to Table 2, Figure 6, Figure S.7 in Section 6.1 and Section S.7.
* `/DC_energy.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure 7 in Section 6.2.
* `/DC_mnist.R`: Produces results corresponding to Table S.1 in Section S.2.1.
* `/DC_temperature.R`: Produces results corresponding to Figure S.5 in Section S.2.2.

In `src` folder: 
* `/DC_mainfunctions.R`: Contains all main functions necessary for the simulations and real data analysis.

In `Figures` folder: Contains all figures from the main manuscript and supplement saved as `.png` or `.pdf` files. All figures except Figures 1 depend on the `Figures_code` folder.

In `Figures_code` folder: This folder contains R scripts used to reproduce each figure in both the main manuscript and supplement.
* `/Figure2.R`-`/Figure7.R`: Generate Figure 2 through Figure 7 in main manuscript. The figures are automatically saved as PDF files.
* `/FigureS1.R`-`/FigureS10.R`: Generate Figure S.1 through Figure S.10 in the Supplement. The figures are automatically saved as PDF files.
